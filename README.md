# User study for the Exo editor project

Thanks again for participating in this user study! We greatly appreciate your time and feedback.

There are four quizzes in total. We ask half of participants to complete quiz1&3 with text editor (quiz2&4 with the interactive editor), and another half of participants to complete quiz2&4 with your choice of the text editor.

Before diving into quizzes, let's familialize ourselves with Exo and the interactive editor interface.

- You can access the interactive editor from [here](http://98.82.12.243:8080/). Take a moment to explore the default schedule.
- You can install Exo to use it in your text editor easily by `pip install exo-lang`. Make sure `exocc --version` shows 0.2.1.

After completing quizzes (should not take more than ~40 minutes), we ask you to complete the survey from [this link](https://forms.gle/tLZA8UUExGv6mPaJ6).
